<!-- Car Rental System

Overview:
The Rental Car Management System is a command-line application designed to streamline the process of managing and renting cars for both customers and employees of a car rental company. The system allows customers to browse available cars, rent vehicles, view rental history, and manage their rental information. Employees, on the other hand, can add new cars to the system, update car information, view all cars, rent cars to customers, view rental records, and perform other administrative tasks.

User Stories:
